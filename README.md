# Letter_Cancellation

The project aims at reproducing a basic version of the Letter Cancellation test that is mainly used to gauge a person's reflexes
and focus.

<h3><strong>How to reproduce the environment locally:</strong></h3>
1. Clone this repository
   ```git clone https://github.com/aryanrana/Letter_Cancellation.git```
   
2. Check that the stylesheet and the main HTML file are in the same folder.

3. Run the HTML file in an appropriate program.

Thus, you have the Letter Cancellation test with a single stimulus letter ready to run on your own system.
